            The hardest part of applying Continuous Delivery (CD),
            is the organizational change required to get it fully applied
        </p>

        <p>
            In software development Continuous Integration is already
            a standard practise, Continuous Delivery and Continuouse Deployment
            are --technically-- just the final mile
        </p>

        <p>
            In the Delivery and Deployment phases, activities like
            User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and arranging/configuring
            the deployment infrastructure are often long running,
            and therefore release blocking
        </p>

        <p>
            Using Pipeline, the whole software workflow from commit
            till the consumer can use it, is handled on one place.
            Making it seemingly clear what blocks the quick and
            continuous delivery and deployment flow to the consumer
        </p>

        <p>
            Blockings can then be discussed with the product owner and
            stakeholders to be solved
        </p>

        <p>
            Automation is key. Therefor Pipeline maintains everything
            version-controlled. The pipeline workflow, all its external
            dependencies, environment configuration, everything
        </p>

        <p>
            Pipeline hooks into existing tools, as long as the tool has
            a command-line interface (CLI) or and API, it can be used
            in Pipeline
        </p>

        <p>
            As the pipeline is user for the whole software workflow,
            it has differen types of users:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Developers</dt>
            <dd>who want deep insight in build and automated test phases</dd>

            <dt>Testers</dt>
            <dd>who want to see versions they can pull, test and sign-off after
                all automated tests already passed
            </dd>

            <dt>The business</dt>
            <dd>wants to deploy ready versions to the consumer</dd>

            <dt>And the pipeline maintainer</dt>
            <dd>wants to maintain the pipeline, experiment and test it
                from one single place without interrupting others
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            Different users with different requirements, therefore different
            user interfaces (UI)
        </p>

                        Patrick gets 8 hours of the workweek to work on Pipeline, and
                        Martin may do design work for Pipeline during the workdays. This
                        while having the agreement that everything created for Pipeline
                        is Open-Source and not owned by Tricode in any way.
